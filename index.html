    <h1>EvoQuery Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last Updated: December 31, 2024</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>EvoQuery is a Chrome extension that queries multiple AI models simultaneously and analyzes consensus across their responses. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.</strong></p>
    
    <h2>How the Extension Works</h2>
    <p>When you use EvoQuery:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your query is sent to our secure backend API</li>
        <li>Our backend forwards the query to AI services (Claude, Grok, OpenAI)</li>
        <li>Responses are returned to your browser and displayed</li>
        <li>No queries or responses are stored on our servers</li>
        <li>All processing is transient (temporary)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chrome Storage</h2>
    <p>The extension uses Chrome's local storage API solely to save user interface preferences. This data stays on your device and is never transmitted to us.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>EvoQuery uses the following third-party AI services to process queries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anthropic (Claude)</li>
        <li>xAI (Grok)</li>
        <li>OpenAI (GPT-4o Mini and embeddings)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your queries are sent to these services through our backend API. Please refer to each service's privacy policy for information on how they handle data.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All communication between the extension and our backend uses HTTPS encryption. Our backend is hosted on Railway with industry-standard security practices.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>EvoQuery is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
